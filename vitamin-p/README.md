# Vitamin-P: Vision Transformer Assisted Multi-Modality Expert Network for Pathology

This project implements a multi-expert model for pathology image analysis, combining Vision Transformers with a mixture of experts approach to handle both H&E and mIF image modalities.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place your H&E and mIF datasets in the appropriate directories under `data/raw/`
4. Adjust the configuration files in the `configs/` directory as needed
5. Run the main script: `python src/main.py`
